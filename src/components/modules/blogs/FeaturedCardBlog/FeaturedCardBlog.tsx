It is important to vary the oils in the kitchen to take advantage of the benefits of each. Rapeseed oil is an oil rich in omega 3 which participate in the proper functioning of the cardiovascular system as well as in vitamins E which contributes to the protection of cells against oxidative stress. In short, oils are your friends ðŸ˜‰",
