          "body": "We brew our sake in one of the highest breweries in Japan, standing at an altitude of 940m and surrounded by an abundance of nature. While many breweries typically use a stable water source such as well water, narai uses the fresh water from the mountains, flowing from an altitude of over 1,000m. The water originates from a spring near the watershed of the Shinano River and Kiso River, and is characterized by its clarity and smooth, rounded texture brought about by a rare “water hardness” of less than 25."
