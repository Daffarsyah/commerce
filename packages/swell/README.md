## Swell Provider

Copy the `.env.template` file in this directory to `.env.local` in the main directory (which will be ignored by Git):

Visit https://www.swell.is/, under your account, for the env variables

```bash
cp packages/swell/.env.template .env.local
```

Then, set the environment variables in `.env.local` to match the ones from your store.
